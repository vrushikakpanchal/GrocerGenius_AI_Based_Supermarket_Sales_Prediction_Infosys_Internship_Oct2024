# **GrocerGenius: AI-Based Supermarket Sales Prediction**  

## **Overview**  
GrocerGenius is a data-driven solution aimed at transforming supermarket operations by accurately forecasting sales. By analyzing historical sales data and outlet characteristics, the project empowers retail managers to make informed decisions, optimize inventory, and boost customer satisfaction. This repository contains the complete implementation of the project, including data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, machine learning models, and deployment via an API.

## **Project Workflow**  
1. **Data Collection & Exploration**  
   - Define objectives and inspect the dataset.  
   - Address missing values and data inconsistencies.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize sales patterns, seasonal trends, and relationships between features.  

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Impute missing values.  
   - Perform feature engineering and encode categorical features.  

4. **Model Building & Evaluation**  
   - Train multiple models like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression.  
   - Optimize performance using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.  

5. **Deployment**  
   - Build a REST API using Flask for real-time predictions.
